            <h1>A Personal Response to Michael F. Buckley's Perspective</h1>
            <h2>By Namuun Enkhtaivan - February 2, 2024</h2>

        <main>
            <p> In Michael F. Buckley's article <strong> "Design is dead. And we have killed it.," </strong> he brings
                up a comparison between Nietzsche's <em> "God is dead" </em> and the idea that <em> "Design is dead,"
                </em> which really got me thinking about the changes happening in our industry. It's like we're facing a
                cultural shift, and AI is at the forefront of it all. The author compared this cultural shift to the
                creation of the atomic bomb when the world became a darker place because of the lack of humanity behind
                the tool of destruction. </p>



            <p> Buckley talks about design as a <em> "translator," </em> making information understandable and usable,
                whether it's through visuals, tactics, or experiences. This made me think about how AI could potentially
                take over these translation tasks, leaving traditional designers wondering about their place in the
                field. However, I wonder if there's more to design than just translation – maybe it's about creativity
                and human connection, things that AI might struggle to replicate. AI cannot read human intention and
                that is one of its weaknesses. We designers can understand and follow through on intentional ideas and
                that makes the design more human which is something future clients will want instead of the picture
                perfect squeaky clean overly designed webpages from AI. </p>



            <p> The article then gets real about the fear and uncertainty surrounding AI's integration into design.
                Buckley's personal reflections and candid language really hit home, making me realize just how much the
                industry is changing and how uncertain the future feels. But at the same time, it's a wake-up call to
                adapt and stay ahead of the curve. Change is constant and this is a part of life. </p>



            <p> Buckley presents evidence of AI's efficiency in performing design tasks, like building websites, faster
                and cheaper than humans. While it's impressive, it also raises concerns about job security and the
                quality of AI-generated designs. It's a reminder that we need to stay vigilant and not underestimate the
                impact of AI on our profession. </p>



            <p> Ethical considerations about job displacement and loss of human creativity hit hard. Buckley doesn't
                offer concrete solutions, leaving us to grapple with these dilemmas on our own. It's a tough reality
                check, forcing us to confront the ethical implications of AI in our industry. </p>



            <p> The discussion about AI's predictive analytics capabilities and their potential to enhance user
                experience is fascinating. But it also raises questions about the future of human creativity and the
                role of designers in a world dominated by AI-driven solutions. It's a reminder that while technology can
                enhance our work, it can also challenge our value as designers. However, one thing to remember is that
                despite the magnetic pull of AI’s capabilities the newer generations of people and designers are
                steering away from overly designed predictive technologies to stay healthy. The humans of the future are
                focused more on better health and steering away from an overly technological future. So, there is
                something to look forward to when it comes to personalized predictive AI’s future with these newer
                generations. </p>



            <p> Buckley's call for adaptability and preparedness resonates deeply. His acknowledgment of uncertainty and
                the need to acquire new skills feels like a rallying cry for designers to stay relevant in a rapidly
                changing landscape. It's a reminder that we can't afford to be complacent – we need to keep learning and
                evolving. Despite the uncertainty, Buckley suggests that the human element in design may endure through
                <em> "organic designers" </em> who prioritize human-centered approaches. It's a hopeful vision, but it
                also raises questions about the feasibility of maintaining human creativity in a technology-driven
                world. It's a reminder that while AI may change the way we work, it can't replace the human touch. </p>



            <p> In conclusion, Buckley's article leaves me feeling both hopeful and apprehensive about the future of
                design. It's a reminder that while AI brings exciting possibilities, it also poses challenges that we
                need to confront head-on. By reflecting on Buckley's insights and staying open to new ideas, I believe
                we can navigate the complexities of AI's impact on our industry and emerge stronger and more resilient.
