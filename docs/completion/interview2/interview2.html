    Relationship: my best friend of 6 years
    In a heartfelt exchange with my longtime friend Cheyenne, we delved into the profound 
topic of personal growth and the journey to becoming our best selves. As the conversation 
unfolded, it became evident how intertwined our experiences have been over the years. 
Cheyenne reminisced, "You've always been a very hard worker since I've known you." She 
reflected on my evolution, noting, "I think what I've seen from you professionally is like a 
confidence boost. I've seen you stand up for yourself more and just realize what you're 
willing to deal with and what you're not willing to deal with."  
Upon hearing this, I reflected on moments working in hospitality where I had to stand my 
ground. In the beginning it wasn't easy. My sentences would stumble, and I would tear up 
trying to get the right words together. This kind of resilience was gained from facing this 
version of myself and being okay with stumbling and tearing up. Over time with more 
practice, standing up for myself became a bigger asset to my character.  
Back to the present conversation with Cheyenne, our discussion then shifted to 
Cheyenne's own journey of self-discovery. She candidly shared, "Every day I think about 
where I want to be and where I'm not." Reflecting on her growth, Cheyenne revealed, "If I 
was to show myself five years ago where I am today, five years ago, I'd be very happy." 
Amidst our reflections, Cheyenne courageously opened up about facing a challenging toxic 
relationship, acknowledging, "Being in a toxic relationship wasn't good for my psyche or 
me." She spoke of the struggle to navigate through heartbreak and self-recovery, 
emphasizing her determination to move forward. Could it be that heartbreak is the kind of 
push we need to grow as a human being? I have entertained this thought for a while, and it 
seems like an inevitable train collision that we all face in today's dating scene. Thus, that 
would mean everyone should be a better human being after every relationship. However, 
that is only realistic in an ideal world. Not everyone learns from their mistakes.  
One pivotal moment Cheyenne described was the purchase of her electric harp, stating, 
"When I bought that, I was like, 'Yeah, no, this is everything I did led me up to that.' It just 
kinda makes sense." This decision marked a turning point in her journey, affirming her 
commitment to authenticity and creative expression. 
Our conversation also touched upon the profound impact of our friendship on each other's 
personal growth. Cheyenne expressed appreciation, saying, "I feel like we're both just 
really good support systems in each other's lives." She emphasized the importance of 
mutual respect and understanding in fostering growth and emotional resilience. 
As our discussion drew to a close, Cheyenne and I reflected on our individual strengths 
and areas for growth. While acknowledging each other's strengths—her candidness and 
my rationality—we also recognized the importance of embracing vulnerability and 
cultivating meaningful connections. 
In retrospect, our conversation served as a poignant reminder of the transformative power 
of introspection and shared experiences. Through mutual support and self-reflection, we 
continue to navigate the complexities of personal growth, each step forward a testament 
to resilience and authenticity.
