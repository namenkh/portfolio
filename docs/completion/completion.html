                <h3>
                    Reflection
                </h3>
                <p>Reflecting on my journey, I've realized the importance of hobbies and habits that both my younger and
                    future selves would be proud of. At the age of 10, I dreamt of being someone who could cook
                    delicious meals and nurture plants, so I've taken up those hobbies. Trying out new recipes and
                    caring for my plants not only brings me joy but also connects me with my childhood dreams.</p>

                <p>In our discussion, Cheyenne and Megan listened intently as I shared my reflections on cultivating
                    these hobbies and habits. Cheyenne nodded in agreement, acknowledging the significance of pursuing
                    activities that align with our authentic selves. Megan, too, shared her own experiences of finding
                    solace and fulfillment in hobbies that resonate with her inner child.</p>

                <p> As for habits, I've made a conscious effort to follow through on my promises and commitments. This
                    habit not only builds trust with others but also strengthens my integrity and self-discipline.
                    Additionally, I've developed a habit of reading intellectually stimulating books. This not only
                    expands my knowledge but also keeps me mentally sharp and engaged.</p>

                <p>Cheyenne and Megan expressed admiration for my dedication to these practices, recognizing the
                    positive impact they've had on my personal growth. Cheyenne remarked on the importance of
                    consistency in developing habits, citing her own journey of incorporating mindfulness practices into
                    her daily routine.</p>

                <p>Looking ahead to my 30-year-old self, I envision someone who is capable, disciplined, and
                    intellectually curious. By nurturing these hobbies and habits, I'm laying the groundwork for a
                    future self that embodies these qualities. It's a journey of growth and self-improvement that I'm
                    proud to be on.</p>

                <p>Our conversation served as a reminder of the transformative power of intentional self-care and
                    personal development. Together, we affirmed the importance of honoring our past selves while
                    striving to become the best versions of ourselves in the future. In sharing our journeys and
                    aspirations, we found strength and encouragement, knowing that we are not alone in our pursuit of
                    growth and fulfillment.</p>
